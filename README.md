# omnifood-project
This is my clone project from the course [https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/]('Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS') on udemy.com 
I'm not sure I remember all the techniques available in this course as well as in this project, but I clone and upload the project here as my reference in the future.
I have deployed the project onto netlify
