# omnifood-project
This is my clone project from the course 'Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS' on udemy.com 
I'm not sure I remember all the techniques available in this course as well as in this project, but I clone and upload the project here as my reference in the future.
I have deployed the project onto netlify
